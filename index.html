    <b> <font face="cournier new" size="4">Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</font>  was a great leader and the founder of Pakistan. 
        He was born on December 25, 1876, in Karachi, India (now Pakistan). Jinnah was a 
        skilled lawyer, politician, and statesman who dedicated his life to fighting for the
        rights of Muslims in India. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Jinnah was a strong believer in the power of education and worked hard to improve the 
        education system in India. He also fought for women's rights and social justice. In 
        1913, Jinnah joined the All-India Muslim League, which later became the Pakistan 
        Muslim League. He became the leader of the party and worked tirelessly to unite 
        Muslims across India. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In 1940, Jinnah and the Muslim League launched the Pakistan Movement, which aimed to 
        create a separate homeland for Muslims in India. After years of struggle and 
        negotiations, Pakistan was finally established on August 14, 1947. Jinnah became the 
        first Governor-General of Pakistan and worked to build a strong and prosperous nation. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah is remembered as a hero and a symbol of hope for the 
        people of Pakistan. He is revered for his vision, leadership, and dedication to the 
        cause of Muslim rights and freedom. His legacy continues to inspire people around the 
        world to fight for justice, equality, and human rights. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Some of his famous quotes include: <br>
         <br>
        - "Unity, Discipline, and Faith" <br>
        - "Pakistan is not just a country, it's an ideology" <br>
        - "We are a nation with our own distinct culture and civilization" <br>
         <br>
        Jinnah's birthday, December 25, is celebrated as a national holiday in Pakistan, and 
        his legacy continues to be celebrated and honored by people around the world. <br>

                <h3> *Mazar-e-Quaid: </h3> Also known as the Jinnah Mausoleum or the National Mausoleum, this is the final resting place of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Liaquat Ali Khan, Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah, Abdur Rab Nishtar and Nurul Amin. <br>
                
             <h3>   *Location:</h3> The mausoleum is located in the Jamshed Quarters locality of central Karachi, along the northern edge of the colonial-era core at the end of Muhammad Ali Jinnah Road. <br>
                
              <h3>  *History:</h3> Muhammad Ali Jinnah's death occurred in 1948, and his final resting place was marked by a large white marble slab. In 1952, his mausoleum was capped by a small dome, with a cabinet that contained some of his personal effects along a wall near his grave. The site had an air of neglect which angered many. In 1957, the Government of Pakistan held an international competition to design a new mausoleum for Jinnah. The competition was initially won by British architect William Whitfield, but was rejected by Jinnah's sister, Fatima Jinnah. She then commissioned architect Yahya Merchant, a Bombay-based architect who was a personal friend of Jinnah, to design the monument. <br>
                
               <h3> *Architecture:</h3> The mausoleum was designed in the modernist style popular during the 1960s and 1970s. It appears simple at a distance, but exuberant in its use of material and complex in its detailing when viewed closely. The use of white marble to suggest purity, and pure geometric forms, are designed to portray Jinnah as a larger-than-life figure. The location and style of the monument both serve to inspire passersby. It is clad in white marble, and has curved arches and copper grills set on an elevated 54-square-metre platform. <br>
                
              <h3>  *Significance:</h3> Official and military ceremonies take place here on special occasions, such as on 23 March (Pakistan Day), 14 August (Independence Day), 11 September (the anniversary of Jinnah's death) and 25 December (Jinnah's birthday). Dignitaries and officials from foreign countries also visit the mausoleum during official tours. <br>
